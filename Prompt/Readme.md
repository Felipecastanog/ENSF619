# 📁 prompt

This folder contains the finalized and structured **prompt** used to evaluate and compare Large Language Models (LLMs) — specifically **ChatGPT (GPT-4o)** and **DeepSeek-V3** — for automated code generation in privacy-preserving applications using **Differential Privacy (DP)**.

## 📄 Contents

- `prompt.md`:  
  The complete, step-by-step prompt designed to generate Python code that applies the Laplace mechanism to count records by birth decade in a synthetic dataset.

## 🚀 How to Use

You can copy and paste the contents of `prompt.md` into the interface of any general-purpose LLM with code generation capabilities (e.g., ChatGPT, DeepSeek). Modify file paths and column names as needed to adapt to new datasets.
