# 🔐 ENSF619 — Privacy-Preserving Code Generation with Differential Privacy

This repository contains the full project for the course **ENSF 619** at the University of Calgary:  
**"Comparative Analysis of ChatGPT and DeepSeek for Privacy-Preserving Code Generation using Differential Privacy."**

The project explores how two large language models (LLMs), **ChatGPT (GPT-4o)** and **DeepSeek-V3**, generate executable Python code that applies **Differential Privacy (DP)** to structured tabular data. A synthetic dataset simulating records from the Calgary Drop-In Centre is used to benchmark and compare the models’ performance, focusing on code accuracy, structure, and statistical fidelity.
