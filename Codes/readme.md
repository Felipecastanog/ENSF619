# üìÅ codes

This folder contains all executable Python scripts generated and evaluated as part of the study **"Comparative Analysis of ChatGPT and DeepSeek for Privacy-Preserving Code Generation using Differential Privacy."** The purpose of these scripts is to implement, test, and compare differential privacy (DP) mechanisms applied to synthetic tabular data using code produced by large language models (LLMs) under structured prompting.

## üìÑ Contents

The folder includes the following files:

- `chatgpt_dp_script.py`:  
  Python code generated by **ChatGPT** based on a structured prompt. It applies the Laplace mechanism to compute differentially private counts grouped by birth decade.

- `deepseek_dp_script.py`:  
  Python code generated by **DeepSeek-V3** using the same structured prompt. It also applies the Laplace mechanism for privacy-preserving statistical analysis.

- `visualize_histograms.py`:  
  A utility script for visualizing the true and DP-transformed birth decade histograms and for calculating quantitative evaluation metrics such as **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, and **Pearson correlation**.

- `utils.py`:  
  Supporting functions used across scripts, including data cleaning, decade grouping, and noise application.

## üß© Purpose

This directory demonstrates how LLMs can autonomously generate reproducible and privacy-compliant code for sensitive datasets using Differential Privacy. Each script corresponds to a specific output from the evaluated LLMs and is meant to be tested with a synthetic dataset resembling real-world shelter records. The scripts reflect different coding styles, robustness, and reproducibility standards‚Äîcentral to the comparative study outlined in the project report.

## üìÅ How to Use

1. Place your input dataset (e.g., `ChfSynthData-13_09_2024.csv`) in the root directory.
2. Modify file paths within the scripts if needed.
3. Run the desired script using Python 3.8+ in an environment with the following dependencies:
   - `pandas`
   - `numpy`
   - `diffprivlib`
   - `matplotlib` (for visualization)

These scripts can serve as templates for applying DP in other domains involving structured tabular data.
